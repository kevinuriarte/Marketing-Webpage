## Marketing Webpage

The mock-up of this webpage in this project is dedicated for a marketing and web services agency or company, Horison, and demonstrates the importance or accessibility and semantic HTML.

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./assets/images/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.


## User Story
